        <p>
          Vanady's favorite hobbies are swimming and dancing, even though she
          doesn't know how to dance. She just loves to move to the music and
          have a good time on the dance floor. Swimming is her other passion, as
          she finds it both relaxing and invigorating. Despite her lack of
          formal dance training, Vanady always manages to have a blast and bring
          a smile to everyone's face with her carefree attitude and infectious
          energy.

<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
<p>Swimming and coding are not just activities for me; they are passions that define who I am. When I'm not immersed in the intricacies of software development, I'm diving into the refreshing waters of the nearest pool or natural body of water. The pool is my sanctuary, where each stroke brings a sense of calm and achievement. Likewise, coding fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills, allowing me to build digital solutions that make a difference. These hobbies complement each other, shaping my perspective and enriching my life in unique ways.</p>
